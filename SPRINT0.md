# Paper Tower Challenge 
In this assignment, I was tasked with building the tallest standing structure, only using paper: no tape, no glue, no nothing. 

## Goal Setting 
- Build a tower that reaches 2 metres
- Create a visually appealing tower with an interesting design
- Learn from each attempt and iterate on the design to improve the tower's height or stability

## Research
- My main source of information and knowledge to build the tower came from YouTube
- Watching videos of other people making their designs, and choosing the ones I thought would work out best
- For example, the idea to tie a ribbon around the rolled-up sheets came from this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imaPI3z4gck&ab_channel=STEAMEducation)
